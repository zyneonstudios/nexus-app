## Description
The NEXUS app is a modular and easily extensible desktop application designed to cater to the diverse needs of end-users. Originating as an instance-based Minecraft launcher, it has evolved into a standalone platform. Our primary focus remains on the Minecraft module, serving as a showcase for the capabilities of our modular system and providing a reliable method for managing, sharing, discovering, and playing Minecraft instances in a modern, flexible, and instance-based manner. The Minecraft module supports the installation of mods, maps, resource packs, shaders, and more from platforms such as Zyndex, CurseForge, and Modrinth.
